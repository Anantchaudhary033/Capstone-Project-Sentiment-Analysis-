A sentiment is an attitude, belief, or conclusion brought on by a sensation. Sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining,
examines how individuals feel about particular things. Through different social media, including forums, microblogs, and online social
networking sites, users may publish their own material. Many social media platforms disclose their application programming interfaces
(APIs), which motivates academics and developers to gather and analyse data. However, there are a number of issues with those online
data sources that can make sentiment analysis more difficult. The quality of people's opinions cannot be ensured because they are
allowed to upload their own information, which is the first issue. The second problem is that such internet data's actual source is not
always known. A ground truth is more akin to a label placed on an opinion, designating whether it is favourable, unfavourable, or
neutral.
